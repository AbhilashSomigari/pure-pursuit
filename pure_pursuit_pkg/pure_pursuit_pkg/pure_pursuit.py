"""
Pure pursuit math, kept free of ROS so it can be tested on its own.

Path preparation (once, at start-up):
  1. load_waypoints   - read x, y from the CSV (extra columns are ignored).
  2. prepare_path     - drop points where the recorded car backed up or
                        jittered (forward_only), resample at a uniform
                        arc-length spacing, then circular moving-average
                        smoothing.
  3. speed_profile    - per-waypoint speed limited by lateral acceleration
                        (v = sqrt(a_lat / |kappa|)), then a backward pass so
                        the car can brake in time for the next corner.

Every pose update:
  4. nearest_index    - closest waypoint, searched in a window ahead of the
                        previous one (global search on the first call).
  5. lookahead_point  - first point along the path, going forward from the
                        nearest waypoint, at exactly distance L from the car
                        (circle / segment intersection).
  6. to_vehicle_frame + steering_angle - curvature gamma = 2 y / L^2 of the
     arc through the goal point, steering = atan(wheelbase * gamma).
